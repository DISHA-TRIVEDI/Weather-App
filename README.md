# Weather-App
A weather app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a user-friendly web application that provides real-time weather information to its users. HTML is used to structure the app's user interface, creating elements like input fields, buttons, and containers to display weather data. CSS is employed to style these elements, ensuring an appealing and intuitive design.

JavaScript plays a crucial role in the functionality of the app. It connects to a weather API to fetch current weather conditions, forecasts, and other relevant data based on user input, such as location or ZIP code. This data is then dynamically displayed on the app's interface, updating in real-time to reflect the latest weather information.

Users can interact with the app by entering their location or selecting it from a list, and the JavaScript code handles the request to the API, processes the response, and populates the UI with details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecasts. Additionally, the app may include features like graphical representations, such as icons or charts, to make the weather data more visually engaging.
